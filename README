When using Multi Site in WordPress pinging remote services are disabled by default. I needed 
something that would ping remote services at least once per hour. This is the result.

1. Copy config.template.php to config.php and fill in your database name, username, password and host.
2. Run the script from command line.
3. or make an entry in crontab that runs the script once a hour.

If you have ideas for improvement, please contact me.

Kind regards,
